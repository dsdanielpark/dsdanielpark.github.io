## Main Paper

### Machine learning approaches to optimize small-molecule inhibitors for RNA targeting
- **year:** 2022 
- **url:** <https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-022-00583-x> 
- **abstract:** In the era of data science, data-driven algorithms have emerged as powerful platforms that can consolidate bioisosteric rules for preferential modifications on small molecules with a common molecular scaffold. Here we present complementary data-driven algorithms to minimize the search in chemical space for phenylthiazole-containing molecules that bind the RNA hairpin within the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our results indicate visual, geometrical, and chemical features that enhance the binding to the targeted RNA. Functional validation was conducted after synthesizing 10 small molecules pinpointed computationally. Four of the 10 were found to be potent inhibitors that target hairpin 91 in the ribosomal PTC of M. tuberculosis and, as a result, stop translation.

### Combining Machine Learning and Computational Chemistry for Predictive Insights Into Chemical Systems
- **year:** 2021
- **url:** <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00107> 
- **abstract:** Machine learning models are poised to make a transformative impact on chemical sciences by dramatically accelerating computational algorithms and amplifying insights available from computational chemistry methods. However, achieving this requires a confluence and coaction of expertise in computer science and physical sciences. This Review is written for new and experienced researchers working at the intersection of both fields. We first provide concise tutorials of computational chemistry and machine learning methods, showing how insights involving both can be achieved. We follow with a critical review of noteworthy applications that demonstrate how computational chemistry and machine learning can be used together to provide insightful (and useful) predictions in molecular and materials modeling, retrosyntheses, catalysis, and drug design.
