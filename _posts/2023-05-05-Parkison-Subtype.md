## Main Paper
### Prognosis and Neuropathologic Correlation of Clinical Subtypes of Parkinson Disease 
- **year:** 2019

- **abstract:** Importance Clinical subtyping of Parkinson disease at diagnosis is useful in estimating disease course and survival. Severity and rate of progression of neuropathologies are important determinants of clinical Parkinson subtypes. Objective To provide longitudinal clinical disease-course data and neuropathologic correlation for newly proposed Parkinson disease subtypes. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with autopsy-confirmed Parkinson disease who were regularly seen throughout their disease course by hospital specialists in the United Kingdom and donated their brain at death to the Queen Square Brain Bank between January 2009 and December 2017. Patients with additional neuropathologic diagnoses, monogenic forms of parkinsonism, or insufficiently detailed clinical information were excluded. Based on severity of motor symptoms, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and autonomic and cognitive function at diagnosis, patients were classified adapting a subtyping classification into mild-motor predominant, intermediate, or diffuse malignant subtypes. Main Outcomes and Measures Time from diagnosis to disease milestones (recurrent falls, wheelchair dependence, dementia, and care home placement) and death were compared between subtypes, and their risk was estimated using Cox hazard regression models. Severity and distribution of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer disease–related pathology were assessed using staging systems. Results From a total of 146 patients, 111 patients were included (67 men [60.4%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 62.5 [11.5] years). The diffuse malignant subtype had earlier development of milestones and reduced survival. Cox proportional hazard regression showed an increased adjusted risk of any disease milestone (hazard ratio, 10.90; 95% CI, 5.51-21.58; P < .001) and death (hazard ratio, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.98-6.75; P < .001) in the diffuse malignant group. Age at diagnosis was the only additional variable with statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.17; P <.001). Staging of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer disease–related pathology did not differ between subtypes, although they showed different rates of progression, and the latter was associated with age at death. Conclusions and Relevance Parkinson clinical subtypes at diagnosis may estimate disease course and survival, which may be useful in providing a more accurate prognosis in individual patients in clinical practice and helping to stratify subgroups in clinical trials. Different severity and progression of neuropathologies are important determinants of Parkinson subtypes, and age at diagnosis should be included in future subtype classifications.

### α-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease
- **year:** 2012 
- **url:** <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3281589/> 
- **abstract:** α-Synuclein is a presynaptic neuronal protein that is linked genetically and neuropathologically to Parkinson's disease (PD). α-Synuclein may contribute to PD pathogenesis in a number of ways, but it is generally thought that its aberrant soluble oligomeric conformations, termed protofibrils, are the toxic species that mediate disruption of cellular homeostasis and neuronal death, through effects on various intracellular targets, including synaptic function. Furthermore, secreted α-synuclein may exert deleterious effects on neighboring cells, including seeding of aggregation, thus possibly contributing to disease propagation. Although the extent to which α-synuclein is involved in all cases of PD is not clear, targeting the toxic functions conferred by this protein when it is dysregulated may lead to novel therapeutic strategies not only in PD, but also in other neurodegenerative conditions, termed synucleinopathies.

- **abstract:** : In patients with early, otherwise untreated Parkinson's disease, the abilities of selegiline (deprenyl) and tocopherol, antioxidative agents that act through complementary mechanisms, to delay the emergence of more severe disability requiring treatment with levodopa were evaluated. Eight hundred subjects were randomly assigned in a two-by-two factorial design to receive selegiline (10 mg per day), tocopherol (2000 IU per day), selegiline and tocopherol, or placebo and were followed up to determine the frequency of development of disability requiring treatment with levodopa, the primary end point. Interim analysis performed by an independent safety monitoring committee prompted a preliminary comparison of the 401 subjects assigned to tocopherol or placebo with the 399 subjects assigned to selegiline, alone or with tocopherol. During an average of 12 months of follow-up, only 97 subjects who received selegiline reached the end point. In contrast, 176 subjects who did not receive selegiline reached the end point during this period (P < 10(-8)). Selegiline was also found to be well tolerated and to have a small, but statistically significant symptomatic benefit. These results indicate that use of selegiline (10 mg per day) in patients with early, otherwise untreated Parkinson's disease, delays the emergence of more severe disability.

- **abstract:** Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common a gerelated neurode generative diseases, affecting 1% of the population older than 60 years of age and 0.3% of the general population. It is a chronic, progressive disorder whose spectrum of clinical features can affect an individual for more than 40 years of his or her natural life span. Idiopathic PD is clinically and pathologically a heterogeneous disorder that is variable inprogression and phenotypic expression. With no known biomarker for disease diagnosis or progression, clinicians and scientists have long recognized the importance of classifying patterns of PD into distinct subtypes in order to identify features that influence rate of progression and response to interventionsand that correlatewithneural and biochemical substratesofdisease pathogenesis. To that end,HoehnandYahr in their landmark studyof 1967mayhave been among the earliest clinical scientists to recognize the heterogeneity of PD by describing that “the clinical picture of one may be dominated by tremor, of another by rigidity or akinesia,”1(p433) andsubsequentlydevelopedascale to ratehow symptomsof PDprogress.Disability stagingby theHoehnand Yahrscalecontinues to be used universally in ratingdiseaseand progressionas it relates towalkingandpostural stability. 1 More recently, the global Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (with its subscales that assessmentation,mood andbehavior, activities of daily living,motor and nonmotor symptoms, and complicationsoftherapy)has introducedtheimportanceofnonmotorsymptoms in impactingqualityof life. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which allows for a bedside evaluation of 8 domainsof cognition,hasbeenadded to the repertoireof clinicalmeasures that informcliniciansof the functional stateof the patientwith PD. Although powerfully informative, thesemeasures, which are routinely performed by neurologists, and the standardof care formovementdisorders fall short indetermining prognosis or predicting rate of change for patientswith PD. In this issue of JAMA Neurology, Fereshtehnejad et al2 introduceanovel subtypingschemederivedfromclusteranalysis of a prospectively observed large cohort of patients with earlyPDidentifiedat theCenter forAdvancedResearch inSleep Medicine, Hopital du Sacre–Coeur deMontreal, andMontreal General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. To our knowledge, it is the second data-driven clinical research studywith longitudinal observation, and the first to propose a scheme in whichnonmotor symptomsare the clinical determinants indefining subtypes of PD. Importantly, orthostatic hypotension (OH), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and rapid eye movements leep behavior disorder (RBD)presentat initial visits were the defining features for a “diffuse/malignant” sub group of patients with PD who had the most rapid rate of progression. Overthelastseveraldecades,differentphenotypicsubtypes havebeenproposed, largelybasedon2classificationmethods: an empirically assigned (predefined) classification scheme or adata-drivenclassificationscheme.Specificclinical featuresthat favoredhypothesis-drivenempiricalclassificationschemeswere developed fromclinical observationsof study cohorts that examinedsuchfactorsasageatsymptomonset, levodoparesponsiveness, familial history,motor symptompredominance, dementia,depression,andrateofprogression.Themostdominant clinical subtyping of PD emerged from motor subtyping into tremor-dominantvsnontremor-dominantPD(patientswithpredominant bradykinesia, akinesia, and postural instability and gait dysfunction [PIGD]) and indeterminate or mixed phenotypes.The distinction between these phenotypicmotor subtypes was often referred to asbenign vs malignant in reference to the more rapid rate of deterioration and greater cognitive impairment exhibited by patients with the akinetic-dominant subtype. Current practice parameter guidelines for disease prognosis predict that older age at onset and the presence of rigidity/ hypokinesiaorPIGDas initial symptomsdescribe amore rapid rateofmotorprogressionandearly cognitivedecline,whereas thepresenceof tremor as an initial symptompredicts a slower progression and a longer response to levodopa therapy.3 Contrary to this conventional knowledge, a 2012 studybyVuet al4 proposed that tremorandPIGD-dominant subtypeswere not distinctsubtypesreflectingtheheterogeneityofPDbutweredifferent stagesof thediseaseprocess, and that tremorprogresses moreslowlythanothercardinalmotorsymptoms,whereasPIGD is less responsive to levodopa therapy. In fact, the cardinalmotor featuresofPD (including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and PIGD)progress atdifferent rates andshowvariable responsiveness to levodopatherapy,challengingthe ideathatbaselinemotor subtypeclassification is a significantpredictorofdeath,depression, or cognitive decline.4,5 Some clinician-scientists advocate that clinical subtypes derived from empirical classification schemes create more distinct groups,which are simpler to identify using readily available rating scales, while others advocate that this approach is limited because the complexity of the features frommotor and nonmotor symptoms isnot assessed.6As a consequence, cluster analysis has become the preferred method for subtyping, mostly because it is a hypothesis-free analysis that removes the conditional bias of choosing specific criteria based on experience, thusallowingunexpectedpatterns toappearandproRelated article page 863 Opinion

### Comprehensively modeling heterogeneous symptom progression for Parkinson's disease subtyping 
- **year:** 2021

- **abstract:** The Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease, of which the etiological and pathological mechanisms remain unclear to date. PD has been associated with diverse movement dysfunctions and non-motor symptoms (i.e., symptom heterogeneity) and progression patterns of these symptoms differ from patient to patient (i.e., progression heterogeneity). To address these, the present investigation aims at comprehensively considering full progression course of early PDs to identify subtypes, each of which can reflect unique PD progression pattern. We retrospectively analyzed the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and the Parkinson Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) as the development and validation cohorts, respectively. An unsupervised deep learning model was built to model progression trajectories in diverse clinical manifestations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to produce a representation vector for each patient, encoding his/her symptom progression profile. Then by performing clustering analysis on the patients' representation vectors, we identified three subtypes with distinct PD progression patterns in the PPMI cohort: Subtype I, mild baseline severity and mild symptom progression; mild baseline severity and moderate progression; and Subtype III, rapid symptom progression. Replication in the PDBP validation cohort demonstrated reproducibility of the subtypes. After that, we explored demographic factors, CSF biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers in brain regional atrophy, and genetic factors of the subtypes. Last, to enhance usability of the subtypes, predictive model of subtypes that relies on data at baseline and 1-year follow-up was trained. In conclusion, the identified subtypes revealed significant symptom progression patterns of PDs. Patients with similar baseline severities can even suffer from different progression pattern, leading to distinct prognosis. Demographic factors, biomarkers, and genetic components of the subtypes suggested distinct biological mechanisms and pathways potentially leading to those progression patterns. Our findings may benefit pathophysiological study, clinical practice, and clinical trials to advance PD.

### Development of Passive Immunotherapies for Synucleinopathies

- **abstract:** Immunotherapy using antibodies targeting alpha‐synuclein has proven to be an effective strategy for ameliorating pathological and behavioral deficits induced by excess pathogenic alpha‐synuclein in various animal and/or cellular models. However, the process of selecting the anti‐alpha‐synuclein antibody with the best potential to treat synucleinopathies in humans is not trivial. Critical to this process is a better understanding of the pathological processes involved in the synucleinopathies and how antibodies are able to influence these. We will give an overview of the first proof‐of‐concept studies in rodent disease models and discuss challenges associated with developing antibodies against alpha‐synuclein resulting from the distribution and structural characteristics of the protein. We will also provide a status on the passive immunization approaches targeting alpha‐synuclein that have entered, or are expected to enter, clinical evaluation. © 2015 Movement Disorder Society

### Parkinson's disease subtypes: lost in translation?

- **abstract:** Like many neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease (PD) is clinically highly heterogeneous. A number of studies have proposed and defined subtypes of PD based on clinical features that tend to cluster together. These subtypes present an opportunity to refine studies of aetiology, course and treatment responsiveness in PD, as clinical variability must represent underlying biological or pathophysiological differences between individuals. In this paper, we review what subtypes have been identified in PD and the validation they have undergone. We then discuss what the subtypes could tell us about the disease and how they have been incorporated into studies of aetiology, progression and treatment. Finally, with the knowledge that they have been incorporated very little into PD clinical research, we make recommendations for how subtypes should be used and make some practical recommendations to address this lack of knowledge translation.

### Biomarker‐driven phenotyping in Parkinson's disease: A translational missing link in disease‐modifying clinical trials 
- **year:** 2017 
- **url:** <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5abf05713ac01f6033db02039e1ccef98a6a8065> 
- **abstract:** Past clinical trials of putative neuroprotective therapies have targeted PD as a single pathogenic disease entity. From an Oslerian clinicopathological perspective, the wide complexity of PD converges into Lewy bodies and justifies a reductionist approach to PD: A single‐mechanism therapy can affect most of those sharing the classic pathological hallmark. From a systems‐biology perspective, PD is a group of disorders that, while related by sharing the feature of nigral dopamine‐neuron degeneration, exhibit unique genetic, biological, and molecular abnormalities, which probably respond differentially to a given therapeutic approach, particularly for strategies aimed at neuroprotection. Under this model, only biomarker‐defined, homogenous subtypes of PD are likely to respond optimally to therapies proven to affect the biological processes within each subtype. Therefore, we suggest that precision medicine applied to PD requires a reevaluation of the biomarker‐discovery effort. This effort is currently centered on correlating biological measures to clinical features of PD and on identifying factors that predict whether various prodromal states will convert into the classical movement disorder. We suggest, instead, that subtyping of PD requires the reverse view, where abnormal biological signals (i.e., biomarkers), rather than clinical definitions, are used to define disease phenotypes. Successful development of disease‐modifying strategies will depend on how relevant the specific biological processes addressed by an intervention are to the pathogenetic mechanisms in the subgroup of targeted patients. This precision‐medicine approach will likely yield smaller, but well‐defined, subsets of PD amenable to successful neuroprotection. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Parkinson Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective 
- **year:** 2017 
- **url:** <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2f092a0215fc12782c44fcc063b955f8f746c34> 
- **abstract:** There are two central premises to this evolutionary view of Parkinson disease (PD). First, PD is a specific human disease. Second, the prevalence of PD has increased over the course of human history. Several lines of evidence may explain why PD appears to be restricted to the human species. The major manifestations of PD are the consequence of degeneration in the dopamine-synthesizing neurons of the mesostriatal neuronal pathway. It is of note the enormous expansion of the human dopamine mesencephalic neurons onto the striatum compared with other mammals. Hence, an evolutionary bottle neck was reached with the expansion of the massive nigrostriatal axonal arborization. This peculiar nigral overload may partly explain the selective fragility of the human dopaminergic mesencephalic neurotransmission and the unique presence of PD in humans. On the other hand, several facts may explain the increasing prevalence of PD over the centuries. The apparently low prevalence of PD before the twentieth century may be related to the shorter life expectancy and survival compared to present times. In addition, changes in lifestyle over the course of human history might also account for the increasing burden of PD. Our hunter-gatherers ancestors invested large energy expenditure on a daily basis, a prototypical physical way of life for which our genome remains adapted. Technological advances have led to a dramatic reduction of physical exercise. Since the brain release of neurotrophic factors (including brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is partially exercise related, the marked reduction in exercise may contribute to the increasing prevalence of PD.

### Clinical criteria for subtyping Parkinson’s disease: biomarkers and longitudinal progression 
- **year:** 2017 
- **url:** <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/682f9c41911a240fbefcb7f3771efa136881b7c4> 
- **abstract:** Parkinson's disease varies widely in clinical manifestations, course of progression and biomarker profiles from person to person. Identification of distinct Parkinson's disease subtypes is of great priority to illuminate underlying pathophysiology, predict progression and develop more efficient personalized care approaches. There is currently no clear way to define and divide subtypes in Parkinson's disease. Using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, we aimed to identify distinct subgroups via cluster analysis of a comprehensive dataset at baseline (i.e. cross-sectionally) consisting of clinical characteristics, neuroimaging, biospecimen and genetic information, then to develop criteria to assign patients to a Parkinson's disease subtype. Four hundred and twenty-one individuals with de novo early Parkinson's disease were included from this prospective longitudinal multicentre cohort. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using data on demographic and genetic information, motor symptoms and signs, neuropsychological testing and other non-motor manifestations. The key classifiers in cluster analysis were a motor summary score and three non-motor features (cognitive impairment, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and dysautonomia). We then defined three distinct subtypes of Parkinson's disease patients: 223 patients were classified as 'mild motor-predominant' (defined as composite motor and all three non-motor scores below the 75th percentile), 52 as 'diffuse malignant' (composite motor score plus either ≥1/3 non-motor score >75th percentile, or all three non-motor scores >75th percentile) and 146 as 'intermediate'. On biomarkers, people with diffuse malignant Parkinson's disease had the lowest level of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β (329.0 ± 96.7 pg/ml, P = 0.006) and amyloid-β/total-tau ratio (8.2 ± 3.0, P = 0.032). Data from deformation-based magnetic resonance imaging morphometry demonstrated a Parkinson's disease-specific brain network had more atrophy in the diffuse malignant subtype, with the mild motor-predominant subtype having the least atrophy. Although disease duration at initial visit and follow-up time were similar between subtypes, patients with diffuse malignant Parkinson's disease progressed faster in overall prognosis (global composite outcome), with greater decline in cognition and in dopamine functional neuroimaging after an average of 2.7 years. In conclusion, we introduce new clinical criteria for subtyping Parkinson's disease based on a comprehensive list of clinical manifestations and biomarkers. This clinical subtyping can now be applied to individual patients for use in clinical practice using baseline clinical information. Even though all participants had a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, patients with the diffuse malignant subtype already demonstrated a more profound dopaminergic deficit, increased atrophy in Parkinson's disease brain networks, a more Alzheimer's disease-like cerebrospinal fluid profile and faster progression of motor and cognitive deficits.

### Limits of the genetic revolution.

- **abstract:** The genetic revolution will touch all disciplines of medicine, much like the antibiotic discoveries in the last century did. However, genetic medicine is not an immediate "magic bullet" for all noninfectious conditions. Despite the sometimes melodramatic announcements by the lay media, there are hurdles to overcome before genetic treatments become as ubiquitous as antibiotics. These barriers fall into 3 categories: molecular, economic, and behavioral. First, the molecular difficulties include the biochemical complexity of genes and genetic disease, variation in pathogenesis among races, and gene-environment interaction. Second, economic disincentive to develop orphan drugs, and the expense of such medications, may hinder production of treatments for truly rare genetic diseases. Third, patients are unlikely to be any more compliant with new medications or recommendations than they are with the current ones. The "magic bullet" of folic acid is not used by the majority of women who are aware of its usefulness in preventing birth defects. While the genetic revolution has much potential, the complexity of genetics itself is difficult and the current barriers to useful treatment will not change. As with oncological and transplantation technology, great strides are likely to be made, but only at a measured pace.

### Do prions cause Parkinson disease?: The evidence accumulates 
- **year:** 2014

- **abstract:** Prions are infectious agents that are comprised solely of misfolded proteins and unlike typical infectious agents do not contain nucleic acids. Prion proteins are characterized by a propensity to misfold, form potentially toxic oligomers/aggregates, polymerize to generate amyloid plaques, and cause neurodegeneration. In addition, the misfolded proteins act as a template to promote misfolding of the native protein to continue the process, and spread to involve neighboring neurons to extend the neurodegenerative process in an infectious manner. Mad cow disease is perhaps the most widely known prion disorder; human prion diseases include Creutzfeldt–Jacob disease, Kuru, Gerstmann–Str€aussler–Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia. A body of evidence now suggests that Parkinson disease (PD) may also be a prion disorder, and that a-synuclein may be a prion. a-Synuclein was initially implicated in the etiopathogenesis of PD with the discovery that mutations in the protein are associated with a rare, autosomal dominant, familial form of the disease. Subsequently, it was recognized that a-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the pathologic hallmark of the more common sporadic form of PD. The importance of a-synuclein in PD pathogenesis was further highlighted with the discovery that duplication or triplication of the wild-type a-synuclein gene can also cause a familial form of PD. This observation indicates that increased levels of even the normal a-synuclein protein are sufficient to cause the disease. The possible role of a-synuclein in causing PD was dramatically advanced with the remarkable discovery of Lewy pathology in healthy embryonic dopamine neurons that had been implanted into the striatum of PD patients. These aggregates stained positively for both a-synuclein and thioflavin-s, consistent with the possibility that asynuclein had transferred from affected to unaffected dopamine neurons, and had misfolded to assume a beta sheet–rich configuration. Based on these observations, we and others proposed that a-synuclein might be a prion, and PD a prion disorder. Like the PrP protein, a-synuclein assumes an alpha helical configuration when bound to membranes, misfolds to form beta-rich sheets, forms toxic oligomers and aggregates that are associated with neurodegeneration, polymerizes to form amyloid plaques (ie Lewy bodies), and appears to spread from affected to unaffected neurons. Considerable laboratory evidence has now accumulated to support the prion hypothesis in PD. a-Synuclein uptake by neurons has been demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Several studies by the group of Lee and colleagues have demonstrated that intracerebral injection of purified a-synuclein fibrils results in the accumulation of a-synuclein aggregates in host neurons, transfer of aggregates from terminals to cell bodies, neurodegeneration, and extension of a-synuclein pathology to involve anatomically related neighboring neurons. Specifically, injection of a-synuclein fibrils into the striatum leads to a-synuclein aggregates and neurodegeneration in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons and motor dysfunction. These findings have been observed in both transgenic mice that overexpress a-synuclein and wild-type mice, but importantly do not occur in a-synuclein–null animals. This important observation is consistent with a prion process whereby a-synuclein aggregates act as a template to promote misfolding of host a-synuclein in a prion conformer–like reaction, but which does not occur when there is a deficiency in host a-synuclein necessary for this reaction. Further support for the prion concept comes from studies demonstrating that inoculates derived from the brains of older, sick transgenic rodents overexpressing a-synuclein accelerate the illness and mortality when injected into the brains of younger, intact transgenic animals. The ultimate proof that a-synuclein is a prion and that PD is a prion disorder rests upon a demonstration that inocula of Lewy pathology derived from the brains of human patients can induce a-synuclein aggregates and neurodegeneration in animal models, as has been observed in other prion diseases. Watts et al recently reported that inoculates derived from Lewy pathology in patients with multiple system atrophy induced widespread a-synuclein aggregates throughout the

- **abstract:** Objectives To use a data-driven approach to determine the existence and natural history of subtypes of Parkinson’s disease (PD) using two large independent cohorts of patients newly diagnosed with this condition. Methods 1601 and 944 patients with idiopathic PD, from Tracking Parkinson’s and Discovery cohorts, respectively, were evaluated in motor, cognitive and non-motor domains at the baseline assessment. Patients were recently diagnosed at entry (within 3.5 years of diagnosis) and were followed up every 18 months. We used a factor analysis followed by a k-means cluster analysis, while prognosis was measured using random slope and intercept models. Results We identified four clusters: (1) ﻿ fast motor progression with symmetrical motor disease, poor olfaction, cognition and postural hypotension; (2) mild motor and non-motor disease with intermediate motor progression; (3) severe motor disease, poor psychological well-being and ﻿ poor sleep with an intermediate motor progression; (4) slow motor progression with tremor-dominant, unilateral disease. Clusters were moderately to substantially stable across the two cohorts (kappa 0.58). Cluster 1 had the fastest motor progression in Tracking Parkinson’s at 3.2 (95% CI 2.8 to 3.6) UPDRS III points per year while cluster 4 had the slowest at 0.6 (0.1–1.1). In Tracking Parkinson’s, cluster 2 had the largest response to levodopa 36.3% and cluster 4 the lowest 28.8%. Conclusions We have found four novel clusters that replicated well across two independent early PD cohorts and were associated with levodopa response and motor progression rates. This has potential implications for better understanding disease pathophysiology and the relevance of patient stratification in future clinical trials.

### Patterns and stages of α-synucleinopathy 
- **year:** 2008 
- **url:** <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62b2b4939250a358e46bc91aa9653a358a71b7c0> 
- **abstract:** Background: It is proposed that α-synucleinopathy (AS) initially affects the medulla oblongata and progresses to more rostral brain areas in a hierarchical sequence (“Braak hypothesis”). Predominant involvement of the amygdala is also described. This study examines the applicability of these patterns, and their relationship to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, in brains of a population-based donor cohort. Methods: Brains donated in two of six Cognitive Function and Ageing Study cohorts (Cambridgeshire and Nottingham) were examined. More than 80% were older than 80 years at death. The respondents were evaluated prospectively in life for cognitive decline and dementia. Immunocytochemistry for tau and α-synuclein was carried out in 208 brains to establish Braak stage and the pattern and severity of AS. Results: Seventy-six brains showed Lewy bodies. Half (51%) conformed to the Braak hypothesis while 17% had pathology in a higher region which was absent in a lower region. A further 29% showed amygdala-predominant pathology. Six brains showed predominant neocortical pathology with minimal pathology in amygdala or substantia nigra. The stage of AD pathology was not associated with particular patterns of AS. Conclusion: α-Synucleinopathy (AS) is common in older people, and frequently associated with Alzheimer disease–type pathology. Although half of brains corresponded to the Braak hypothesis, and 29% to amygdala-predominant AS, there were a high proportion of cases which did not fit a staging system. An unexpectedly high proportion with a cortical form of Lewy body disease was identified.

### Lack of α‐synuclein does not alter apoptosis of neonatal catecholaminergic neurons 
- **year:** 2004 
- **url:** <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/729a88c4f577a92121f73da445a50544f28ef46e> 
- **abstract:** α‐Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein of uncertain function linked to Parkinson's disease. Numerous studies have proposed an antiapoptotic function for α‐synuclein, based on overexpression experiments in cell lines. To explore whether α‐synuclein has such a physiological function, we assessed the response of wild type or α‐synuclein null neonatal mouse sympathetic neurons to nerve growth factor deprivation, a well‐characterized stimulus of neuronal apoptosis. There was no difference in the rate of neuronal loss, neuronal apoptosis, or c‐jun phosphorylation. Furthermore, the absence of α‐synuclein did not alter the magnitude of naturally occurring cell death in vivo in substantia nigra pars compacta. Therefore, α‐synuclein is unlikely to play a significant role in apoptotic signalling in catecholaminergic neurons of the neonatal nervous system.

- **abstract:** Woodpeckers experience forces up to 1200–1400 g while pecking. It is assumed due to evolutionary adaptations, the woodpecker is immune to brain injury. This assumption has led to the use of the woodpecker as a model in the development of sports safety equipment such as football helmets. However, it is unknown at this time if the woodpecker brain develops neuro-trauma in relation to the high g-forces experienced during pecking. The brains of 10 ethanol preserved woodpeckers and 5 ethanol preserved red-winged black bird experimental controls were examined using Gallyas silver stain and anti-phospho-tau. The results demonstrated perivascular and white matter tract silver-positive deposits in eight out of the 10 woodpecker brains. The tau positive accumulations were seen in white matter tracts in 2 of the 3 woodpeckers examined. No staining was identified in control birds. The negative staining of controls birds contrasted with the diffuse positive staining woodpecker sections suggest the possibility that pecking may induce the accumulation of tau in the woodpecker brain. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship.

- **abstract:** For years, patient advocates have pointed to the growing toll of Alzheimer9s disease and its burgeoning costs to the U.S. health care system. Spurred by those projections and a controversial national goal to effectively treat the disease by 2025, Congress has tripled the National Institutes of Health9s annual budget for Alzheimer9s and related dementias over 3 years to $1.9 billion. The National Institute on Aging, which oversees the new funds, doesn9t just want to plump up existing Alzheimer9s labs. The institute is also luring investigators from other fields to bring in fresh ideas. But the recent failure of several major Alzheimer9s clinical trials has amplified concerns that U.S. officials and some scientists have oversold the plan for a treatment by the middle of the next decade.

### Elephants, Parkinson's Disease, and Proof‐of‐Concept Clinical Trials 
- **year:** 2018

- **abstract:** We all know the proverbial story of the committee attempting to agree on the description of an elephant. Now, more than 200 years on from James Parkinson’s codification of his now-eponymous syndrome, with his hopeful statement predicting the discovery of diseasemodifying therapies, 145 years after the publication of Charcot’s teachings (reviewed by Goetz), 50 years since the advent of effective means of using levodopa to treat the motor symptoms of the disease, and 20 years into the synuclein era, the elephant that is PD still sits in the room with us. And that elephant has a mate, the proof-of-concept (PoC) clinical trial. Elephant #1 intrudes itself in our thinking by reminding us that as much as we think we know about the etiopathogenesis of PD, we still lack crucial information linking genetic and protein abnormalities to the myriad intracellular pathways affected in multiple cell types that ultimately lead to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We lack efficient techniques to account for the clinical heterogeneity of patients, impeding our ability to adequately differentiate and stratify patients most appropriate for enrollment in clinical trials, as well as tools to directly measure the impact of underlying brain pathology in relation to patients’ functional impairments and disabilities. Thus, in our current state of knowledge, there are critical gaps that we must do our best to fill. Elephant #1 gets a lot of attention, as elegantly described by Lang and Espay in this issue of the journal. Elephant #2, the PoC beast, gets a lot less attention. But what exactly constitutes “proof”? And of what “concept”? So how should we define these terms? On Wikipedia, the definition of “PoC” reads: “Proof of concept (PoC) is a realization of a certain method or idea in order to demonstrate its feasibility, or a demonstration in principle with the aim of verifying that some concept or theory has practical potential. A proof of concept is usually small and may or may not be complete.” However, in drug development, we need to be concerned not just with the potential of an approach, but also with its utility, as we will be investing many dollars and years, demanding much of our colleagues and patients and their families, and possibly asking them to participate in an endeavor to the exclusion of others that may have greater promise. So for the purposes of describing “proof of concept” in pharmaceutical development, we might want to consider a more directed construct, for example, the idea that:

### The emerging science of precision medicine and pharmacogenomics for Parkinson's disease 
- **year:** 2017

- **abstract:** Current therapies for Parkinson's disease are problematic because they are symptomatic and have adverse effects. New drugs have failed in clinical trials because of inadequate efficacy. At the core of the problem is trying to make one drug work for all Parkinson's disease patients, when we know this premise is wrong because (1) Parkinson's disease is not a single disease, and (2) no two individuals have the same biological makeup. Precision medicine is the goal to strive for, but we are only at the beginning stages of building the infrastructure for one of the most complex projects in the history of science, and it will be a long time before Parkinson's disease reaps the benefits. Pharmacogenomics, a cornerstone of precision medicine, has already proven successful for many conditions and could also propel drug discovery and improve treatment for Parkinson's disease. To make progress in the pharmacogenomics of Parkinson's disease, we need to change course from small inconclusive candidate gene studies to large‐scale rigorously planned genome‐wide studies that capture the nuclear genome and the microbiome. Pharmacogenomic studies must use homogenous subtypes of Parkinson's disease or apply the brute force of statistical power to overcome heterogeneity, which will require large sample sizes achievable only via internet‐based methods and electronic databases. Large‐scale pharmacogenomic studies, together with biomarker discovery efforts, will yield the knowledge necessary to design clinical trials with precision to alleviate confounding by disease heterogeneity and interindividual variability in drug response, two of the major impediments to successful drug discovery and effective treatment. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

- **abstract:** IMPORTANCE There is increasing evidence that Parkinson disease (PD) is heterogeneous in its clinical presentation and prognosis. Defining subtypes of PD is needed to better understand underlying mechanisms, predict disease course, and eventually design more efficient personalized management strategies. OBJECTIVES To identify clinical subtypes of PD, compare the prognosis and progression rate between PD phenotypes, and compare the ability to predict prognosis in our subtypes and those from previously published clustering solutions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study. The cohorts were from 2 movement disorders clinics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (patients were enrolled during the period from 2005 to 2013). A total of 113 patients with idiopathic PD were enrolled. A comprehensive spectrum of motor and nonmotor features (motor severity, motor complications, motor subtypes, quantitative motor tests, autonomic and psychiatric manifestations, olfaction, color vision, sleep parameters, and neurocognitive testing) were assessed at baseline. After a mean follow-up time of 4.5 years, 76 patients were reassessed. In addition to reanalysis of baseline variables, a global composite outcome was created by merging standardized scores for motor symptoms, motor signs, cognitive function, and other nonmotor manifestations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in the quintiles of the global composite outcome and its components were compared between different subtypes. RESULTS The best cluster solution found was based on orthostatic hypotension, mild cognitive impairment, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, anxiety, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II and Part III scores at baseline. Three subtypes were defined as mainly motor/slow progression, diffuse/malignant, and intermediate. Despite similar age and disease duration, patients with the diffuse/malignant phenotype were more likely to have mild cognitive impairment, orthostatic hypotension, and RBD at baseline, and at prospective follow-up, they showed a more rapid progression in cognition (odds ratio [OR], 8.7 [95% CI, 4.0-18.7]; P < .001), other nonmotor symptoms (OR, 10.0 [95% CI, 4.3-23.2]; P < .001), motor signs (OR, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.8-9.1]; P = .001), motor symptoms (OR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.3-6.2]; P < .01), and the global composite outcome (OR, 8.0 [95% CI, 3.7-17.7]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE It is recommended to screen patients with PD for mild cognitive impairment, orthostatic hypotension, and RBD even at baseline visits. These nonmotor features identify a diffuse/malignant subgroup of patients with PD for whom the most rapid progression rate could be expected.

### Resistance to Alzheimer Disease Neuropathologic Changes and Apparent Cognitive Resilience in the Nun and Honolulu-Asia Aging Studies 
- **year:** 2017 
- **url:** <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77311cf02880cefe569e4eb6784acb2ebf802f29> 
- **abstract:** Two population-based studies key to advancing knowledge of brain aging are the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS) and the Nun Study. Harmonization of their neuropathologic data allows cross comparison, with findings common to both studies likely generalizable, while distinct observations may point to aging brain changes that are dependent on sex, ethnicity, environment, or lifestyle factors. Here, we expanded the neuropathologic evaluation of these 2 studies using revised NIA-Alzheimer's Association guidelines and compared directly the neuropathologic features of resistance and apparent cognitive resilience. There were significant differences in prevalence of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, small vessel vascular brain injury, and Lewy body disease between these 2 studies, suggesting that sex, ethnicity, and lifestyle factors may significantly influence resistance to developing brain injury with age. In contrast, hippocampal sclerosis prevalence was very similar, but skewed to poorer cognitive performance, suggesting that hippocampal sclerosis could act sequentially with other diseases to impair cognitive function. Strikingly, despite these observed differences, the proportion of individuals resistant to all 4 diseases of brain or displaying apparent cognitive resilience was virtually identical between HAAS and Nun Study participants. Future in vivo validation of these results awaits comprehensive biomarkers of these 4 brain diseases.

- **abstract:** Background Commonly used neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are useful for diagnosis but poor at predicting outcomes. We explored whether an atrophy pattern from whole-brain structural MRI, measured in the drug-naïve early stage, could predict PD prognosis. Methods 362 de novo PD patients with T1-weighted MRI (n=222 for the main analysis, 140 for the validation analysis) were recruited from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We investigated a previously identified PD-specific network atrophy pattern as a potential biomarker of disease severity and prognosis. Progression trajectories of motor function (MDS-UPDRS-part III), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), and a global composite outcome measure were compared between atrophy tertiles using mixed effect models. The prognostic value of the MRI atrophy measure was compared with 123I ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography, the postural-instability-gait-disturbance score, and cerebrospinal fluid markers. Findings After 4.5 years follow-up, PD-specific atrophy network score at baseline significantly predicted change in UPDRS-part III (r=-0.197, p=0.003), MoCA (r=0.253, p=0.0002) and global composite outcome (r=-0.249, p=0.0002). Compared with the 3rd tertile (i.e. least atrophy), the tertile with the highest baseline atrophy (i.e. the 1st tertile) had a 3-point annual faster progression in UPDRS-part III (p=0.012), faster worsening of posture-instability gait scores (+0.21 further annual increase, p<0.0001), faster decline in MoCA (−0.74 further annual decline in MoCA, p=0.0372) and a +0.38 (p=0.0029) faster annual increase in the global composite z-score. All findings were replicated in a validation analysis using 1.5T MRI. By comparison, the other biomarkers were limited in their ability to predict prognosis either in the main or validation analysis. Interpretation A PD-specific network atrophy pattern predicts progression of motor, cognitive, and global outcome in PD, and is a stronger predictor of prognosis than any of the other tested biomarkers. Therefore, it has considerable potential as a prognostic biomarker for clinical trials of early PD.
