Your advice, encouragement, or inquiries of any kind are always appreciated. Don't hesitate to get in touch via the GitHub issue page, email, or whichever method suits you best. I remain open to new opportunities and ideas, and I'm happy to consider any side project collaboration proposals. My primary expertise lies in Python development, with intermediate to advanced abilities in AI models, data analysis, and machine learning. I also have knowledge and certifications in Solidity and Golang, and a keen interest in backend and frontend development. Embracing a learning mindset, I continuously find joy in creating new things.
