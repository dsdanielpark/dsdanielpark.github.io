I am striving to become a perceptive developer and a proficient, agile engineer. I believe that, ultimately, all the knowledge I've gained will harmonize at the end of this journey. Currently, I work as a developer in Korea, with a strong passion for artificial intelligence. My experience includes project execution and planning for major corporations such as the Hyundai Motor Group.
