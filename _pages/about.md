안녕하세요. 박민우입니다. <br>
I am striving to become a perceptive developer and a proficient, agile engineer. I believe that, ultimately, all the knowledge I've gained will harmonize at the end of this journey. Currently, I work as a developer in Korea, with a strong passion for artificial intelligence. My experience includes project execution and planning for major corporations such as the Hyundai Motor Group.

South Korea, Seoul.

#### *Where there’s a will, there’s a way.*
I am training to become a insightful developer and a skillful and quick-witted engineer. <br>
